# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is my notes file. 

<!-- > [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Are you someone who loves writing stories, but feel like you don't have anyeone to share your passion with? Well, now that's been solved. Story Forrest is a website that will let writers share their hobby with others who share this intrest. Here, you can post a short summary of a story you want to write, and you and others can comment on and "like" each other's ideas, providing additional ideas and positive feedback. Now you can enjoy the thrill of explaining your story ideas to others and hearing their own more than ever!

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Design of three pages, login, feed/comments, and creating a post. This will create the structure of the site. Also, navigation allowed between "feed/comments page" and "creating a post" page. Creates a "like" button icon. Also, holds text and titles. 
- **CSS** - Make the page look good through coloration and text sizing.
- **React** - Submit comments/gifs and stories and allows the "like" button to be used.
- **Service** - Allowing users to login.
              - gets gifs from an external api
              - retreive storis and comments and like counts from database.
              - adding stories and comments and like counts to database.
- **DB/Login** - Stores users and passwords. Database stores stories, comments and likes, and which go to what story
- **WebSocket** - instant updates of the "like" button.
