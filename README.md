# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is my notes file. 

<!-- > [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Are you someone who loves writing stories, but feel like you don't have anyeone to share your passion with? Well, now that's been solved. Story Forrest is a website that will let writers share their hobby with others who share this intrest. Here, you can post a short summary of a story you want to write, and you and others can comment on and "like" each other's ideas, providing additional ideas and positive feedback. Now you can enjoy the thrill of explaining your story ideas to others and hearing their own more than ever!

- like button for each story

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Design of three pages, login, feed/comments, and creating a post. This will create the structure of the site. Also, navigation allowed between "feed/comments page" and "creating a post" page. Creates a "like" button icon. Also, holds text and titles. 
- **CSS** - Make the page look good through coloration and text sizing.
- **React** - Submit comments/gifs and stories and allows the "like" button to be used.
- **Service** - Allowing users to login.
              - gets gifs from an external api
              - retreive storis and comments and like counts from database.
              - adding stories and comments and like counts to database.
- **DB/Login** - Stores users and passwords. Database stores stories, comments and likes, and which go to what story
- **WebSocket** - instant updates of the "like" button.

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

Changes - Added images the Images file and all three html pages to html layouts.

- [x] **HTML pages** - Created a login, index (storeis and comments), and a writeStory page.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - Used header, nav, div, body and section. Included html and head tag. All pages implement html elemnts to create the page. footer was used, but is currently empty in all pages.
- [x] **Links** - navigation links in header, login button navigates to homepage. Also a github link
- [x] **Text** - Text is used for labeling across the website
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - comment shows where this goes in the index page
- [x] **Images** - small images are included next the website title in the index page and login page. One is also included next to some top text in the writeStory page.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - this is created with html. there is a username and password field along with a submit button. This serves as a placeholder as it has not been fully implemented yet, but it does navigate to the index page.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - lorem ipsum is used to show where stories and comments would be. these come from the database. The number of likes is displayed next to the like button. Gif's id will be stored in the database and then refetched in the website. A Gif is shown.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - This is the like button and there is a comment identifying it as the websocket element.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.


I have 4 css files, one for each page and a headerFooter file that is used in every page.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Header with title and navigation. footer with github repo link. Universal across all three pages.
    - index.html - login area
    - home.html - scrollable main area for storys. Sidebar with three section for comments. Top is to read other people's comments, below that is navigation for going between writing a comment or posting a gif. below is the writing comment section. below that and extremely tiny is the gif area. All that is there is a post button and some text. The comment sidebar is super squished because I will have navigation to change what the comment sidebar displays. NOTE: because not all elements in the comment section are complete, like the switchable display and the gif 3rd party call are not yet present, some css for those elements was left unfinished as the css would be easier to do after those elemnts are made. 
- [x] **Navigation elements** - colored and styled buttons for comment navigation. colored buttons for page navigation. 
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - minor functionality. There are only two @media sections for this part. One gets rid of the header and footer under a certain height and the other gets rid of the comment section. They are in headerFooter.css and home.css respectively. no other elements were specifically designed to be resized. 
- [x] **Application elements** - There is a lot of css in this program, but the bulk of the elements are text and div elements due to the nature of this website. There are colored s with opacity to see thorugh them in login and the large window in home. All elements in the pages are organized. gif in comment section is appropriately sized. text areas in the comment section and write story page are appropriately sized. padding on various elements and using "gap:" helps with asthetic. flex columns are everywhere. rows are used for comment and like buttons, as well as possibly other places. 
- [x] **Application text content** - all text font changed to trebuchet MS. Some manual font resizing as well in random elements. labels are appropriately positioned.
- [x] **Application images** - background image is a forrest. a parchement image is used for the comment and writestory areas. There is also a small picture next to the site title in the header and a quill picture near a header in writeStory.css.
